## Introduction

`MotifPeeker` is used to compare and analyse datasets from epigenomic
profiling methods with motif enrichment as the key benchmark. The package
outputs an HTML report consisting of three sections:  

1. **General Metrics**: Overview of peaks-related general metrics for the
datasets (FRiP scores, peak widths and motif-summit distances). 
2. **Known Motif Enrichment Analysis**: Statistics for the frequency of
user-provided motifs enriched in the datasets. 
3. **De-Novo Motif Enrichment Analysis**: Statistics for the frequency of
de-novo discovered motifs enriched in the datasets and compared with known
motifs.

## Installation 

`MotifPeeker` uses
[`memes`](https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/memes.html)
which relies on a local install of the
[MEME suite](https://meme-suite.org/meme/). Installation instructions can be
found [here](https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/vignettes/
memes/inst/doc/install_guide.html).

**NOTE:** It is important that Perl dependencies associated with MEME suite are
also installed, particularly `XML::Parser`, which can be installed using the
following command in the terminal:
```
cpan install XML::Parser
```
For more information, refer to the Perl dependency section of the MEME suite
[here](https://meme-suite.org/meme/doc/install.html#prereq_perl).

Once the MEME suite and its associated Perl dependencies are installed,
`MotifPeeker` can be installed using the following code:
```R
if(!require("remotes")) install.packages("remotes")

remotes::install_github("`r paste(owner,repo,sep='/')`")
library(`r pkg`)
```
