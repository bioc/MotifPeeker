Description: MotifPeeker is used to compare and analyse datasets from epigenomic
  profiling methods with motif enrichment as the key benchmark. 
  The package outputs an HTML report consisting of three sections: 
  (1. General Metrics) Overview of peaks-related general metrics for the
  datasets (FRiP scores, peak widths and motif-summit distances). 
  (2. Known Motif Enrichment Analysis) Statistics for the frequency of
  user-provided motifs enriched in the datasets. 
  (3. De-Novo Motif Enrichment Analysis) Statistics for the frequency of
  de-novo discovered motifs enriched in the datasets and compared with known
  motifs.
